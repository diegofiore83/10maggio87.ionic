## Why Ionic
Ionic Framework is an open source SDK that enables developers to build performant, high-quality mobile apps using familiar web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Ionic is focused mainly on the look and feel, or the UI interaction, of an app. This means that it’s not a replacement for PhoneGap or your favorite JavaScript framework. Instead, Ionic fits in well with these projects, in order to simplify one big part of your app development process: the front-end.
